We proposed a diffusion model conditioned on compositional class labels for compositional zero-shot image generation.Starting from the most basic dataset, we employed various methods to achieve Unseen data generation. Eventually, we adopted the approach of using compositional class labels as conditions to guide the generation model. By succeeding with the simplest dataset, we further validated that our model can achieve compositional zero-shot image generation through different datasets. Applying compositional cognitive abilities to the domain of image generation, our model can achieve "learning from old compositional concepts and generalizing to new compositional concepts."
